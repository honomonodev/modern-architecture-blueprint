## Overview

This repository includes:

- **Personal Stack Map** – Tools and strategies I use or recommend
- **Documentation** – System designs, process maps, strategy docs
- **Diagrams** – Visual architecture concepts, security models
- **PoCs (optional)** – Light proof-of-concept directories in the future

## Inspiration

This project is rooted in the belief that **clean architecture**, **security-first thinking**, and **human-centered innovation** are key pillars of sustainable software. It is also influenced by the upcoming paradigm shifts in technology and society — a move from standardized platforms toward adaptable, sovereign digital tools.

## Language & Audience

Documentation is in **English** to ensure accessibility in professional and international contexts.
However, some parts (like the pitch or README) may be available in **Català** as an expression of personal identity and authenticity.
